\f0\fs24 \cf0 My current progress regarding this soundscape is the opening sounds introducing the morning portion of the narrative. This is intentional so that the listener can easily follow a time frame in order to recognize the different sounds in the kitchen. The next step in this project is adding in more of the actual noises from different appliances and foods. These have been recorded and downloaded onto my desktop, but I am importing one sound clip at a time in order to prevent confusion for myself. I wanted to play around with Audacity before importing too many sound files. However, I have a clear plan for the soundscape that will include the rest of the meals throughout the day, I just need to organize them into Audacity. I have also used some supplemental sound files from free sound.org that was recommended in lecture. }
